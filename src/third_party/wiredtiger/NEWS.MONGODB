    Review places that set/clear session->dhandle, replace with macros.  Change callers to save/restore if they need to release a handle after a call.

    The statistics server has open handles and may be opening underlying handles, make sure we don't overwrite them, reference #1694.

    Add an explicit barrier after setting the checkpointing value. (I'm pretty sure it's not actually necessary to have a barrier in the current code, but the barrier we rely on is in a different function and isn't always called, depending the eviction configuration of this file, I'd just rather be safe than try and debug this some time in the future.)

Date:   Mon Feb 23 15:23:54 2015 +1100

    If eviction is walking a file with only one live page (e.g., the last page), be careful to step over it, or eviction's hazard reference can make forced eviction stall.

    If WT_SESSION.truncate isn't given a start cursor, instantiate one, it's always faster to traverse Btree objects in a forward direction.

commit ce38bc5b40f1aa3ffc07cdd2cf993e32143135b5
Author: Keith Bostic <keith@wiredtiger.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 20 08:57:57 2015 -0500

    We don't need to do a search in the row-store cursor truncate setup code, the WT_SESSION.truncate API code already did one.

    This does not mean WT_SESSION.truncate can't return WT_NOTFOUND in some cases, the first thing cursor truncate does is a cursor remove call in order to acquire the page's write generation information -- that remove call does the usual "discard my current reference and get a new one" work, which allows another deleting thread to race and remove one of the truncate's start/stop keys.

Author: Michael Cahill <michael.cahill@wiredtiger.com>
Date:   Wed Feb 18 12:53:41 2015 +1100

    Flip cache overhead to apply to the allocated bytes rather than the total size.  Include the overhead in stats so that tools (e.g., mongostat) report accurate cache full and dirty percentages.  This also makes eviction triggers and targets meaningful: with the default trigger of 95% and overhead 8%, eviction was previously never triggered until the cache was completely full.

    Check if a page was recently split before doing forced eviction.  We used to do this, but it got lost in a recent reorg of __wt_page_release.  This change should mean that after an in-memory split, application threads that are appending have time to move to the new page at the end of the tree, rather than getting stuck trying to force out a page.

    When doing truncates, if we see a clean page in memory, try to evict it before truncating.  It should be cheap (just freeing memory), and if the eviction succeeds, the fast truncate code can kick in and mark the whole page deleted immediately.  Otherwise, truncate will mark each record on the page deleted, and the next time through will try to force that page out, which has to go through reconciliation to figure out that all of the records are deleted.

    There's a problem that went in in #1282, the key difference is that we are setting a split boundary at the end of the first page when there is more than a page worth of data. See also #1630 and #1631. This is an alternate approach to #1631: the real change is to fallthrough into the split case if the next item won't fit, callers of the split code can't handle failure from split, it has to create enough room for the next item to be entered into the buffer.

    In recovery, track the maximum file ID in the metadata, regardless of whether there are any updates to roll forward.

    Previously, we tracked the largest file ID that was updated in the logs being rolled forward.  It was usually the case that the most recently created file was also the most recently updated, so that calculation usually worked and wasn't detected until the repro in SERVER-17142 that created tables, did a clean shutdown and restart, then created more tables and did a dirty shutdown and restart, which was rolling forward updates into the wrong tables.

    Start with clean trees so we can detect updates racing with sweep.

    Use a deleted ref to a leaf page that is created on first update, which is the same state the tree should be in if an empty leaf page is evicted.  The only wrinkle is that bulk operations expect to find a leaf page in the tree: create it explicitly before the bulk insert starts.  This was probably a bug before: if we had created a tree and kept it around for long enough with cache pressure before a bulk load started, the initial leaf page could have been evicted.

    In recovery, track the maximum file ID in the metadata, regardless of whether there are any updates to roll forward.

    Previously, we tracked the largest file ID that was updated in the logs being rolled forward.  It was usually the case that the most recently created file was also the most recently updated, so that calculation usually worked and wasn't detected until the repro in SERVER-17142 that created tables, did a clean shutdown and restart, then created more tables and did a dirty shutdown and restart, which was rolling forward updates into the wrong tables.

    We no longer calculate allocation overhead per allocation chunk, revert the workaround the problem with page memory size calculations during splits where we forced the new parent page memory size to 5% of its current value; reference #1564, #1565. This fixes a problem where 5% of a page's memory footprint isn't large enough to accommodate the cache decrements that will be done in the page's future, leading to page underflow.

    Minor cleanups: we no longer calculate allocation overhead per allocation chunk, the macro WT_MEMSIZE_ADD is no longer needed at all, and WT_MEMSIZE_TRANSFER is renamed to WT_MEM_TRANSFER.

    I believe we can race with pages being marked clean or dirty, which means we need to entirely divorce the page's dirty-byte count from page state: the page's dirty-byte count is just a value that tells us how many dirty bytes this page has contributed to the cache's total dirty-bytes count.  Sync the cache's information to that value when possible, but don't worry if we can't.

    Simplify the cache calculation when a page is marked clean, use the page's dirty-byte count (which allows a race between the page being marked clean and being re-dirtied).

    This branch is still not correct, but appears to be able to run the CONFIG from #1582 without underflow for a much longer time).

    The size of the file is decreasing each time, so compacting 10 times, at 10%, is not sufficient to drive a file to its smallest size. The right fix is probably to get better information from the block manager as to exactly how much the size of the file has decreased, but that's messy, especially when you consider the checkpoints requires to get to that smallest size. For now, do 100 compaction attempts instead of 10, and depend on the no-progress state and/or the compaction timeout to limit the amount of time we spend here.

    We know the handle has been idle, so there is a good chance that a checkpoint has run since the last update and the write leaves was wasted effort.  If not, this change will keep the handle locked for longer preventing new opens, but it has been idle for a while anyway.

    We documented that huffman_key and huffman_value took "none" as an argument, but they didn't.

    Worse, if key was set but not value, we'd set value anyway, free of charge, and if value was set but not key, we'd fail. I doubt this is a problem (it's pretty surprising if anyone would set key but not also set value).

    Use __wt_config_gets_none() to support the "none" setting, re-work the logic to ignore keys or values that are zero-length.

    Reference #1417.

    If we race with the logging thread and get to __wt_logmgr_destroy() while __log_archive_once() is still using conn->log_path, we can free it out from under the running server. If there's a logging thread running, don't free conn->log_path until we've joined that thread.

    We can't use the corrected page size to calculate the buffer's space available, but we don't have a page size either. We do know how much space we added, so use that to increment the space available.

    The raw compression handler can no longer pass a page size buffer to the underlying compression function, because a single key/value object could be larger than the page size, instead, pass a buffer of the same length as the source to compress, whatever that is.

    Separate the btree maximum key/value sizes from the underlying page size, reference #1282.

    Deprecate the internal_item_max and leaf_item_max configuration strings, replace with internal_key_max, leaf_key_max and leaf_value_max.

    Remove examples/c/ex_file.c (there's no real need for a "file" URI example, and it's easy to replace the one place the documentation used it).

    Changed python test suite to allow for shorter runs by default, with a --long (or -l) option for the complete runs.  Txn02 in particular now runs only a small number of scenarios by default.  Also added a @longtest("description") decorator for individual tests that can be marked to be run only under --long.  Refs #1461.

    Sweep old handles more aggressively:

    1. don't have checkpoint or other periodic operations like statistics logging keep old handles alive;
    2. don't wait for all sessions to empty the file from their cache before closing;
    3. only update the time of death from the sweep thread.

    Improve and simplify the LSM switch logic: it is fine to keep writing into a chunk while it is being switched, until either it hits the hard chunk size limit or a switch transaction ID is chosen that is larger than the writer's.  Fixes an assertion failure introduced by #1432 that could write to an old chunk after the switch completed.
