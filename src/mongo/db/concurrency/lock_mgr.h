/*
 * LockManager controls access to resources through two functions: acquire and release
 *
 * Resources can be databases, collections, oplogs, records, btree-nodes, key-value pairs,
 * forward/backward pointers, or anything at all that can be unambiguously identified.
 *
 * Resources are acquired by Transactions for either shared or exclusive use. If an
 * acquisition request conflicts with a pre-existing use of a resource, the requesting
 * transaction will block until the original conflicting requests and any new conflicting
 * requests have been released.
 *
 * Contention for a resource is resolved by a LockingPolicy, which determines which blocked
 * resource requests to awaken when the blocker releases the resource.
